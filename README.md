Machine learning project for predicting breast cancer diagnosis using the Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset.
# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** dataset to build and evaluate supervised machine learning models that can classify tumors as **benign** or **malignant** based on diagnostic imaging features.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is publicly available from:
[Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

It contains:
- 569 samples
- 30 numeric features (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter)
- A target label: `diagnosis` (M = malignant, B = benign)

## 📊 Project Goals

- Load and analyze the dataset
- Build a clean ML pipeline in Google Colab
- Apply classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluate with metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Address ethical and privacy considerations in medical AI

## 💻 Colab Notebook

## 📌 Requirements

This project runs in Google Colab using:
- Python 3
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
